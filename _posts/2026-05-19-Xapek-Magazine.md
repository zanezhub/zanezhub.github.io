> A zine is a magazine that is a "noncommercial often homemade or online publication usually devoted to specialized and often unconventional subject matter". Zines are the product of either a single person or of a very small group, and are popularly photocopied into physical prints for circulation. A fanzine (blend of fan and magazine) is a non-professional and non-official publication produced by enthusiasts of a particular cultural phenomenon (such as a literary or musical genre) for the pleasure of others who share their interest.

Lately I have been reading and downloading as many zines as I can. Most of them are hacking zines, or at least zines that are heavily focused in tech related topics. I'm obsessed with the topics, the design/aesthetic, the way the authors write their articles and how their approach. In this article I'm going to talk about four zines that I think are really cool.

I was watching this [YT video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iogAWecLa-E) when somewhere along the video they mentioned [`Хакер`](https://xakep.ru/issues). When I was younger I never had the luck to get my hands on any sort of hacking magazines/sites, that's why I'm obssesed with them now. It's fascinating to see type of articles they were writing, the style, the covers, the art in every magazine, the way they shaped the text.

This time I will show you some of my favorite pages and some other interesting stuff.

Shows a cool `monkey` talking on the phone. The article mentions that hackers are running MacOS X on PCs.

### Cracklab

This is pretty funny to me. It's almost what you expect from a hacking magazine. This is a cracking tutorial for a software called `EditPlus`. Which is a text editor with FTP, FTPS features.

> “Well, we’ve figured out the program. It should be noted that I used the simplest method of breaking it — byte cracking. Its essence lies in replacing several bytes. As a rule, these are jump bytes. Nowadays, in the world of ‘extreme’ protectors and hardware dongle keys, it would seem there are no programs left that can be cracked this way. However, practice shows otherwise.”

### New Year's DUMP of Ukrtelecom - НОВОГОДНИЙ ДАМП УКРТЕЛЕКОМА

> “In Ukraine, as in most former USSR countries, an unhealthy situation has developed regarding Internet traffic. The quality of the connection is simply terrible, and for these services fairly substantial sums are demanded from not-very-wealthy Ukrainians for network access. A guy approached us who was absolutely dissatisfied with the situation. Without thinking long, he hacked the server of the largest Ukrainian telecom operator and obtained a huge dump of useful information.”

Now, this is very interesting. This is an article that written by the hacker that did this attack on Ukrtelecom, which is a telephone and ISP company company. Apparently is very well known and was also attacked in 2022 by Russia.

According to him, the primary goal was to gain access to the database to dump passwords and payment cards.

The hacker noticied that the site was vulnerable to a SQL injection attack. This was not sucessful, he started another scan against the website. He finds a `.htaccess`.

He also finds an `access_log` file that contains multiple logs, he noticed that was another hacker that was also trying to hack the website, he noticed an URL `www.ukrtelecom.ua//serv/admin` that contained a reference to `ajpv12//localhost:8007`. Here he found some credentials
